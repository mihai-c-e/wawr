Efficient Training Techniques</h4>\nSeveral papers address the need for more efficient training techniques to handle the increasing computational demands of large language models (LLMs). One prominent method is the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, which aim to reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining performance. For instance, LoRA-XS introduces a method that reduces trainable parameters by over 100x compared to traditional LoRA, achieving superior results with significantly fewer resources [305]. Another approach, AdaFisher, leverages a block-diagonal approximation to the Fisher information matrix for adaptive gradient preconditioning, enhancing convergence speed and accuracy [271]. Additionally, methods like LoQT and VeLoRA focus on efficient training by compressing intermediate activations and using gradient-based tensor factorization, respectively, to reduce memory usage and computational costs [276][322].\n\n<h4>2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</h4>\nParameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are crucial for adapting LLMs to specific tasks without incurring high computational costs. Techniques such as LoRA, MoRA, and VB-LoRA have been developed to achieve this. MoRA employs a square matrix for high-rank updating, maintaining the same number of trainable parameters as LoRA but with improved performance on memory-intensive tasks [166]. VB-LoRA introduces a vector bank to share parameters globally, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining or improving performance [238]. These methods demonstrate the potential to fine-tune LLMs efficiently, making them more accessible for various applications [305][166][238].\n\n<h4>3. Quantization and Compression</h4>\nQuantization and compression techniques are essential for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained devices. Methods like SpinQuant and CLAQ focus on low-bit quantization to reduce memory usage and improve inference speed. SpinQuant optimizes rotation matrices to minimize quantization errors, achieving significant improvements in performance with 4-bit quantization [272]. CLAQ introduces column-level adaptive weight quantization, dynamically generating quantization centroids for each column of a parameter matrix, resulting in better performance at extremely low-bit settings [293]. These approaches highlight the advancements in making LLMs more efficient without sacrificing accuracy [272][293].\n\n<h4>4. Enhanced Attention Mechanisms</h4>\nImproving attention mechanisms is a recurring theme in enhancing LLM architectures. Techniques like Lightning Attention and LeaPformers aim to address the computational complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. Lightning Attention maintains constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption by splitting attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks [298]. LeaPformers introduce learned proportions to replace static positional representations, enabling more flexible attention concentration patterns [153]. These innovations demonstrate the potential to improve the efficiency and scalability of attention mechanisms in LLMs [298][153].\n\n<h4>5. Modular and Dynamic Architectures</h4>\nModular and dynamic architectures offer flexibility and efficiency in LLM training and deployment. Methods like LoRA-Switch and MoNDE leverage dynamic adapters and near-data computing to optimize performance. LoRA-Switch introduces a token-wise routing mechanism, merging LoRA adapters and weights for each token to reduce decoding latency [307]. MoNDE reduces parameter movement by computing cold experts inside the host memory device, enhancing the efficiency of MoE LLM inference [342]. These approaches highlight the benefits of modular and dynamic architectures in improving LLM performance and scalability [307][342].\n\n<h4>6. Self-Improvement and Alignment</h4>\nSelf-improvement and alignment techniques are crucial for enhancing LLM capabilities and ensuring they align with human preferences. Methods like Self-Exploring Language Models (SELM) and TS-Align focus on iterative self-improvement and alignment through self-generated feedback and collaborative frameworks. SELM uses a bilevel objective to actively explore out-of-distribution regions, improving alignment performance [355]. TS-Align employs a teacher-student collaborative framework for scalable iterative fine-tuning, enhancing alignment with human preferences [374]. These techniques demonstrate the potential for LLMs to self-improve and align more effectively with human values [355][374].\n\n<h4>7. Long-Context and Memory-Efficient Models</h4>\nAddressing the challenge of long-context modeling and memory efficiency is critical for LLMs. Methods like XL3M and PyramidInfer focus on extending context windows and compressing key-value caches. XL3M uses a training-free framework to enable LLMs to reason with extremely long sequences without further training [309]. PyramidInfer compresses the KV cache by layer-wise retaining crucial context, significantly reducing memory consumption and improving inference throughput [169]. These approaches highlight the advancements in handling long-context inputs and improving memory efficiency in LLMs [309][169].\n\n<h4>8. Improved Positional Encoding</h4>\nEnhancing positional encoding is essential for better handling of long sequences and improving model performance. Methods like CoPE and Decomposed Positional Vectors focus on contextual and decomposed positional encoding. CoPE allows positions to be conditioned on context, enabling more general position addressing [339]. Decomposed Positional Vectors disentangle positional vectors from hidden states, providing insights into the formation and effect of positional information on attention [323]. These innovations demonstrate the potential to improve positional encoding in LLMs [339][323].\n\n</body>\n</html>"

Adversarial Attacks and Defence Mechanisms</h4>\\n    Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can manipulate their outputs by introducing subtle perturbations. Several papers address the development of robust defence mechanisms to counteract these attacks. For instance, innovative fine-tuning techniques and embedding perturbation loss methods have been implemented to bolster model robustness against synonym swapping attacks in conversation entailment tasks <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00289\" target=\"_blank\">[2.0]</a>. Similarly, the use of numerical and acronym-based perturbations in training robust systems for Natural Language Inference on Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) has shown promising results <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00321\" target=\"_blank\">[2.1]</a>. Another approach involves Gaussian Stochastic Weight Averaging combined with Low-Rank Adaptation to improve model generalisation and calibration, thereby enhancing robustness against distribution shifts <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03425\" target=\"_blank\">[2.12]</a>. These methods collectively highlight the importance of fine-tuning and perturbation techniques in defending against adversarial attacks.\\n\\n    <h4>2.2. Test-Time Adaptation and Dynamic Strategies</h4>\\n    Test-time adaptation (TTA) strategies have been explored to enhance the robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) and LLMs. For example, CLIP Adaptation duRing Test-Time (CLIPArTT) dynamically constructs text prompts during inference to improve performance across various datasets without additional training <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00754\" target=\"_blank\">[2.3]</a>. Another study standardises TTA benchmarks to evaluate the adaptability of VLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14977\" target=\"_blank\">[2.76]</a>. These dynamic strategies underscore the potential of TTA in maintaining robust performance in the face of domain shifts and corrupted datasets.\\n\\n    <h4>2.3. Watermarking and Intellectual Property Protection</h4>\\n    Watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect the intellectual property of LLMs and mitigate model extraction attacks. PromptShield, a plug-and-play watermarking method, encapsulates user queries with self-generated instructions to nudge LLMs into generating watermark words without compromising text quality <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02365\" target=\"_blank\">[2.8]</a>. Another study introduces multi-user watermarks, allowing the tracing of model-generated text to individual users, thereby enhancing accountability and preventing misuse <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11109\" target=\"_blank\">[2.45]</a>. These watermarking methods highlight the importance of protecting LLMs from intellectual property theft while maintaining robustness against adversarial attacks.\\n\\n    <h4>2.4. Jailbreak Attacks and Defence Mechanisms</h4>\\n    Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs to generate harmful content. Several defence mechanisms have been proposed to counteract these attacks. For instance, the Momentum Accelerated Greedy Coordinate Gradient (MAC) attack incorporates a momentum term into the gradient heuristic to enhance the efficiency of jailbreak attacks <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01229\" target=\"_blank\">[2.7]</a>. Conversely, defensive strategies such as PARDEN, which asks the model to repeat its outputs to avoid domain shifts, have shown significant improvements in detecting and mitigating jailbreak attacks <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07932\" target=\"_blank\">[2.32]</a>. These studies emphasise the need for robust defence mechanisms to safeguard LLMs against sophisticated jailbreak strategies.\\n\\n    <h4>2.5. Robustness in Multimodal Models</h4>\\n    Multimodal models, which integrate visual and textual data, face unique robustness challenges. For example, the SoraDetector framework detects hallucinations in text-to-video models by evaluating the consistency between video content and textual prompts <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04180\" target=\"_blank\">[2.17]</a>. Another study proposes the use of diffusion models to align the semantic distributions of image encoders, thereby enhancing the robustness of multimodal models against out-of-distribution samples <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15232\" target=\"_blank\">[2.80]</a>. These approaches highlight the importance of robust multimodal integration to ensure reliable performance across diverse datasets and environments.\\n\\n    <h4>2.6. Privacy and Security Concerns</h4>\\n    Privacy and security concerns are paramount in the deployment of LLMs. Techniques such as locally differentially private in-context learning (LDP-ICL) have been proposed to protect sensitive user data from membership inference attacks and prompt leaking attacks <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04032\" target=\"_blank\">[2.16]</a>. Additionally, the AirGapAgent framework restricts the agent\\'s access to only the data necessary for a specific task, thereby preventing unintended data leakage <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05175\" target=\"_blank\">[2.22]</a>. These methods underscore the critical need for robust privacy and security measures to safeguard user data in LLM applications.\\n\\n    <h4>2.7. Robustness in Recommendation Systems</h4>\\n    Recommendation systems leveraging LLMs face challenges in catering to diverse user populations. A hybrid task allocation framework has been proposed to improve robustness by strategically assigning tasks to both LLMs and traditional recommendation systems <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00824\" target=\"_blank\">[2.5]</a>. This approach identifies weak and inactive users and uses in-context learning to enhance ranking performance, thereby improving robustness to sub-populations. These studies highlight the importance of robust recommendation systems that can adapt to varying user needs without compromising performance.\\n\\n    <h4>2.8. Detection and Mitigation of Hallucinations</h4>\\n    Hallucinations, where LLMs generate factually inaccurate outputs, pose significant challenges. The HalluVault framework leverages logic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting fact-conflicting hallucinations <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00648\" target=\"_blank\">[2.4]</a>. Another study introduces a token probability approach to detect hallucinations by employing simple classifiers utilising numerical features derived from token probabilities <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19648\" target=\"_blank\">[2.124]</a>. These methods emphasise the need for robust detection and mitigation strategies to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content.\\n\\n    <h4>2.9. Robustness in Mathematical Reasoning</h4>\\n    Mathematical reasoning tasks present unique robustness challenges for LLMs. The trajectory-based method TV score uses trajectory volatility for out-of-distribution detection in mathematical reasoning, outperforming traditional algorithms <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14039\" target=\"_blank\">[2.67]</a>. This approach highlights the importance of robust detection methods tailored to the specific challenges of mathematical reasoning tasks.\\n\\n    <h4>2.10. Robustness in Biomedical NLP</h4>\\n    Biomedical NLP tasks require robust models to handle diverse and complex data. Retrieval-augmented LLMs (RALs) have been proposed to address hallucination issues by retrieving pertinent information from established databases <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08151\" target=\"_blank\">[2.34]</a>. However, the robustness of RALs against unlabeled, counterfactual, or diverse knowledge remains a challenge. These studies underscore the need for robust biomedical NLP models that can adapt to varying data distributions and maintain reliable performance.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"theme-3\" class=\"inpost-collapsible\">3.
